# Eshaan Adyanthaya  
### Engineer. Researcher. Systems Thinker.

Integrated M.Tech Software Engineering @ VIT Chennai  
AI & Robotics Intern | IEEE Published Researcher | Team Lead  

I build intelligent systems that bridge theory, research, and real-world deployment.

##  What I Work On

###  Neuromorphic & Geometric AI
- Co-author of **SGSPose** (IEEE Access, 2025)
- Designed a neuromorphic-geometric 6D pose estimation pipeline
- Integrated:
  - Spiking Neural Networks (event-driven LIF neurons)
  - Graph Neural Networks
  - SE(3)-Equivariant optimization
- Reduced translation error on 7-Scenes benchmark by **70%+**

I enjoy building models that respect geometry — not just optimize loss.

### Robotics & Intelligent Systems

#### 🔹 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle – Project MIRA 2.0
- Built underwater vision enhancement pipeline (CLAHE, Sobel, LAB processing)
- Developed YOLO & MobileNet-SSD detection models
- Integrated ROS1 with Jetson Xavier + Raspberry Pi
- Real-time marker & obstacle detection in turbid conditions

#### 🔹 Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm (3DOF & 4DOF)
- Built real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe + OpenCV
- Designed joint-mapping logic translating finger kinematics → robotic actuation
- Implemented URDF simulation in RViz before hardware deployment
- Integrated servo control + inverse kinematics

I don’t just simulate robots — I deploy them.

##  Leadership

### Team Manager — Dreadnought Robotics
- Lead Programming, Electrical, Mechanical & Management divisions
- Represent team at national & international competitions
- Coordinate autonomy pipelines for AUV systems

### President — Microsoft Innovations Club
- Lead executive board
- Organized workshops & hackathons
- Expanded technical programs and partnerships

I enjoy building teams as much as I enjoy building systems.

## Engineering Philosophy

I care about:

- Mathematical foundations
- System architecture
- Real-time performance
- Hardware-software integration
- Research-backed implementation

If it works in theory but not in deployment — it's incomplete.
